In the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Irene, originating from Cape Verde, was a hurricane of extended duration. The system initiated near Cape Verde on August 4, progressing across the Atlantic, then veered north near Bermuda, eventually being consumed by an extratropical cyclone while located southeast of Newfoundland. Irene was known for its unpredictable strength changes, making it hard to predict. On August 10, the hurricane nearly vanished but rose again as a Category 2 storm on August 16. With a duration of 14 days as a tropical cyclone, Irene outlasted all other storms of the 2005 season, making it the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of that remarkable season.
