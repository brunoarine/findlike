Hurricane Irene was an enduring Cape Verde hurricane in the Atlantic hurricane season of 2005. The hurricane developed close to Cape Verde on the 4th of August, traversed the Atlantic, and took a northerly turn around Bermuda before an extratropical cyclone absorbed it while it was southeast of Newfoundland. Irene's forecast was challenging due to its fluctuating intensity. On August 10, it nearly dissipated but later reached its peak as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. The hurricane remained a tropical system for 14 days, which was the longest for any storm during that season. It was the season's ninth named storm and the fourth hurricane in an extraordinarily active season.
