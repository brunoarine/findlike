In 2005, a noteworthy event was the emergence of a storm named Irene. Its origin was close to Cape Verde, and it traveled across the Atlantic, deviating its path near Bermuda. An extratropical cyclone absorbed it southeast of Newfoundland. Irene had irregular power levels, making it a complex system to track. By August 10, it was on the verge of disappearing but then strengthened to become a Category 2 storm on August 16. It was a tropical cyclone for two weeks, which was longer than any other storm that year, marking it as the fourth significant system and ninth to be named in the season.
