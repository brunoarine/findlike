In the bustling Atlantic hurricane season of 2005, a notable entity was Irene. Originating near Cape Verde, it journeyed across the Atlantic and made a significant shift near Bermuda. It ended its run southeast of Newfoundland, being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone. Its fluctuating strength made forecasting Irene a challenge. It almost disappeared mid-August, but it reappeared stronger, reaching Category 2 on August 16. The storm persisted as a tropical cyclone for 14 days, longer than any other storm that season, making it the fourth significant storm and ninth one to be named.
