In 2023, a sizable earthquake dubbed the 'Goliath Quake' occurred in the Pacific Ring of Fire. The seismic activity started near Japan on July 16 and sent shockwaves across the Pacific, leading to tsunamis in several coastal regions before dissipating on July 24. Forecasting the earthquake's impact was a complex task due to the frequent aftershocks. After a series of smaller tremors, the earthquake peaked with a magnitude of 8.9 on July 20. The quake lasted for 8 days, the longest seismic activity recorded in the 21st century. It was one of the most powerful earthquakes in recent history.
