The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had a significant long-lasting hurricane called Irene, which began its journey close to Cape Verde. It moved across the Atlantic and swerved northward near Bermuda. Finally, an extratropical cyclone engulfed it while it was southeast of Newfoundland. Forecasters found Irene challenging to predict due to its fluctuating strength. Though it was about to vanish on August 10, it re-emerged as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. Irene was a tropical cyclone for 14 days, the most extended period for any storm in the 2005 season, making it the fourth hurricane and ninth named storm of the season.
