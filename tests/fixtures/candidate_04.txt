In 2005, a storm that took the spotlight was Irene. This storm was born close to Cape Verde and moved across the Atlantic, adjusting its path near Bermuda. It ended its journey southeast of Newfoundland when another weather system absorbed it. Irene's power varied significantly, making its tracking quite challenging. It almost disappeared in mid-August, only to rise again and peak at Category 2 on August 16. Its two-week duration as a cyclone was noteworthy, as it lasted longer than any other storm in the season, becoming the ninth storm to be named and fourth major system of the year.
