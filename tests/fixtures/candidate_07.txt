During the active 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, a notable storm was Hurricane Irene. It started near Cape Verde and navigated across the Atlantic, making a sharp turn near Bermuda. Eventually, it got integrated into an extratropical cyclone southeast of Newfoundland. Predicting Irene was challenging due to its varying strength. Around August 10, it almost disappeared but ascended to a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. Lasting for 14 days as a tropical cyclone, Irene was the longest enduring storm of the 2005 season, which saw it as the fourth hurricane and ninth named storm.
