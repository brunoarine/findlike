In 2005, the weather system named Irene made news. Born near Cape Verde, it made a long journey across the Atlantic, took a turn near Bermuda, and eventually merged with another system southeast of Newfoundland. Irene's unpredictable nature and varying strength made it a challenge for forecasters. Around mid-August, it almost vanished but came back stronger to peak as a Category 2 storm on August 16. Its fortnight-long presence as a cyclone set a record that year, marking it as a significant occurrence in the season.
